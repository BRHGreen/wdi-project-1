# Introduction
**Salvy McMeme Face** is a one player game based on a **The 15 Puzzle** (also known as The Gem Puzzle or Boss Puzzle) a game originally created in 19th century by **Noyes Palmer Chapman**. This was built as my **first project** on the *Web Development Immersive* course at **General Assembly** using **JavaScript**. A hosted version of **Salvy McMeme Face** can be found here *******url*******

# How to play
Upon loading the site the player will be presented with a completed picture. When the player is ready to start they must click on the button below the picture labeled **"Shufflez"**. Once this is clicked the picture will be divided up into eight equally sized square tiles and one blank space which will be displayed in a three by three grid format.


The aim of the game is to **rearrange the tiles to create the completed picture.** This is achieved by **clicking on the tile which you want to move.** Picture tiles can **only be moved into a blank space.** can **only move one space at a time** can **be moved either left, right, up or down**.
